To minimize the "rest", I could consider optional pieces of consumption for each plate of level 1. this pieces would go to the objective function discounting. Here, I need to use the correct weights. 

To guarantee the order, we would have to give an order to each root node and compare the pieces between root nodes and within root nodes. 

To guarantee the defects we could assign demand to the root node and model the sequence of root nodes. 

Another option to guarantee defects and sequence is to build an heuristic to play with the solution and fix it. 

For heuristics:
* Rotate a node in place
* exchange two nodes in a tree. 
  * check that useful parts enter in the other node. 
* exchange two nodes between trees. 
* Change two trees from order. 
* Change two nodes from order. 

Candidate nodes to change:
* nodes that have a bad sequence. 
* nodes that include a defect. 

Candidate nodes to exchange: 
* nodes that have useful sizes that are similar (check rotation). 
* nodes that have slack in terms of sequence in the production chain. 
* nodes that do not have defects. 
* better if in level 2 or 3. 

Evaluation of fitness:
* sequence is improved. 
* defects are not included in pieces. 
* objective function is not too affected. 

* After knowing the defects, it's possible to change or move the pieces inside the nodes so they avoid the defects.
