## A node has

* a type: [-3, -2, -1] or [NODE_IDs]
    - -3: reused residual lead
    - -2: not a leaf
    - -1: wasted leaf
* a parent node
    * or children.
* global position: (x, y)
* size: (W, H)
* global id
* a level cut where it was generated

##Â Resources

use one of these libraries:

* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ete2
* http://networkx.github.io/
    * https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/tree.html

## A cut has

* a node that originate it.
* a level in [1, 2, 3].
* a position in H or W depending on level.

## A cut level has

* id / position: [1, 2, 3]
* orientation: W or H.

## Graph constraints

* leafs need to sum the total area of the PLATE.
* leafs can not overlap.
* leafs need to sum the parent.
